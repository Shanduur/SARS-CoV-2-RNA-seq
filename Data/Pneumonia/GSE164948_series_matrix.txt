!Series_summary	"The exact immunopathophysiology of COVID-19 remains clouded by methodological heterogeneity and a lack of relevant disease controls. The absence of single-cell investigations into the broader population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PBMCs from a strictly matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19, eight patients with CAP, and four non-infectious control subjects. With this balanced, multi-omic approach we describe diverging transcriptional and phenotypic patterns in T cell, NK cell and monocyte populations between patients with CAP caused by either SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A or other pathogens, and thereby expand our understanding of the peripheral immune response in different forms of CAP."

PBMCs were separated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus medium (GE Healthcare Life science, Little Chalfont, UK) and washed twice, first with cold PBS and then with cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% sterile endotoxin-free bovine serum albumin (Divbio Science Europe, Breda, the Netherlands). PBMC’s were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2mm EDTA and the concentration PBMCs was determined using a Coulter Counter. PBMCs were resuspended in IMDM medium containing 20% filter-sterilized fetal calf serum and pen/strep, after which an equal part of the same medium containing 20% DMSO was slowly added while continuously stirring and working on ice. 3-5 million PBMCs were viably stored in 1.8 ml cryogenic vials (Corning #430388), which were steadily brought to -80 degrees Celsius. After 24-72 hours, the cells were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until further analysis. After thawing, all samples averaged 90% viability as determined by FACS analysis. PBMCs were thawed, stained with viability dye and 500,000 cells were sorted using a FACS Sony Sorter selecting alive, singlet cells. The cells were incubated with FC blocker for 10 minutes, after which each sample was incubated with TotalSeq Hashtag antibody tags to enable multiplexing and subsequent deconvoluting. After Hashtag staining the cells were pooled into four pools of five samples, each sample contributing equally to their respective pool. Cells were counted manually by light microscopy and Neubauer chambers. Each pooled sample was then incubated for 30 minutes with our TotalSeq oligo-conjugated antibody panel (see the Key Resources Table) for later surface protein marker quantification."
