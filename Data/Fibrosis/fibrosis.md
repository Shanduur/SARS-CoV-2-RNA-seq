The lungs were infused with 1 mL dispase (Corning) with DNase I (Sigma). 
Lungs were incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 45 minutes, followed by gentle teasing using forceps into small (1-2 mm) fragments and incubation in digestion buffer for another 15 minutes. 
Resulting suspension was passed through passed through 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon), washed with DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 5% FBS (Corning), pelleted by centrifugation and erythrocytes were lysed using BD Pharm Lyse (BD Biosciences). 
Resulting single cell suspension was kept in DMEM/FBS and passed through 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon) two times. 
Cells were counted using Cellometer K2 (Nexcelom) with nucleic acid binding dyes acridine orange (AO) to calculate total number of nucleated cells and propidium iodide (PI) to count dead cells. 
All manipulations were performed using wide bore tips (Axygen).


1. Fastq files processed using CellRanger V2.0 pipeline (10x Genomics), mapping was done to GRCh38 version of human genome.
1. Fastq files were generated using bcl2fastq software (Illumina) as part of CellRanger V2.0 pipeline (10x Genomics) using mkfastq command.
