Dear Sir/Madam,=20

I am a Master's Degree student of Data Science at the Silesian University o=
f Technology. Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis titled "Analysis=
 of smoking status impact on molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry =
through single-cell sequencing experiments". My Supervisor, Ph.D. Anna Papie=
=C5=BC suggested reading the publication as a base, from which I should start my=
 research. ("Integrated analyses of single-cell atlases reveal age, gender, =
and smoking status associations with cell type-specific expression of mediat=
ors of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and highlights inflammatory programs in putati=
ve target cells").

I read the publication and then downloaded the data ("HCA LungMAP COVID-19 =
Smokers/Nonsmokers Lung") from singlecell.broadinstitute.org. Both Smokers a=
nd Nonsmokers datasets consist of only 27 genes within over 373 thousand cel=
ls. After contacting my supervisor with a question about the data - especial=
ly a small number of the genes, she suggested that I should contact you.=20

Going through the Article, I was unable to find any information about the g=
ene selection process. Here emerges my main question - how did you select th=
ose 27 genes as a base for further research?=20

Additionally, I have another question loosely connected with the previous. =
Is there any possibility to obtain the smokers/nonsmokers lung datasets in r=
aw format without preprocessing applied?

Thank you for your time. I am looking forward to your reply.

Yours faithfully
